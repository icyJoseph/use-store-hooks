## TODOS

[ ] Increase test coverage.

## Motivation

Redux is a very powerful concept. This repository aims to share how one could still use the concept without having to ever install `redux` and `react-redux`.

We also provider a bunch of methods to setup a redux-like global store, which connects to Redux Dev Tools and also consumes middleware!
